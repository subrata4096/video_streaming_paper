Smartphones and tablets have become the devices of choice for connecting to the internet and watching videos. Video data contributes to the bulk of internet traffic and, the number, length and variety of videos have increased significantly. 
Mobile devices live on limited battery energy which is still a major bottleneck and a source of user dissatisfaction while watching videos. 
%In this paper we introduce an intermediate framework called \myname for power efficient video delivery to smartphone and tablets.
%This almost transparent battery aware framework takes away some of the video processing overhead from the device and intelligently tunes its parameters %customized for the mobile device while delivering the video using a novel transport protocol. Our preliminary results show that this framework can %significantly reduce energy consumption upto \texttt{50\%} of a mobile device without compromising user experience.  
For this project, we characterize the power efficiency of mobile video streaming services over 4G/3G/Wi-Fi.
We evaluate the energy efficieny of various streaming applications like YouTube, Netflix and aim to identify power wastage in the existing approach.
