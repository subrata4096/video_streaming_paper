A lot of research has been done in improving the power efficiency of mobile and hand-held devices. Different schemes target different features of the device for power reduction. These include network, architecture level, circuit, and software level optimizations. ~\cite{mohapatra_mm03} explores a combination of these optimizations for achieving power efficiency. Some recent literature like ~\cite{mobiarch,movid} also confirm the theory that transmitting video frames in bursts actually save significant amount of energy. A very recent work ~\cite{ucsd_wcnc} uses battery aware rate adaptation and base station reconfiguration to achieve power savings. An interesting work which effectively schedules data transfers in return for energy savings is~\cite{balasubramanian_imc09}.
